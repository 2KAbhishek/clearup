## What is this

clearup is a markdown editor, with support for live previews that allows you to quickly create beautiful markdown documents.

## Inspiration

Wanted to build my own markdown editor with a minimalistic feel.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of `any web browser`

## Getting clearup

To install clearup, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2kabhishek/clearup
cd clearup
```

## How it was built

clearup was built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) and [Marked](https://marked.js.org/) .

## Challenges faced

The main challenge was to setup react and babel in the browser, without using create-react-app or npm.

## What I learned

- Got to try out `babel` on the browser
- Learned a quick way to create a `react` app without much scaffolding
- Learned about `marked` and few other libraries

## What's next

Better code syntax highlighting with [Prism](https://prismjs.com/).
